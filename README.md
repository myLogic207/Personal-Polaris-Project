# PPP - Personal Polaris project

Hi and welcome to my little personal polaris project.
After discovering this funny [Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/Polaris/) I decided to create a little project to experiment with this a little.

This will NOT be a replacement to my other Project [budderBOT](https://github.com/myLogic207/budderAPI/)!

This Project might have bugs or some other problems.

## What is Polaris

[Polaris](https://github.com/PowerShell/Polaris/) is a PowerShell module which allows you to create a custom webservice.
I recommend checking out their GitHub as well if you are interested in learning more about this.
